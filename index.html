              Below you will find some links to things I have worked on. Did I
              use AI? How dare you ask me that. As if I'm some sort of
              vibe-coder... Yeah, I did. I used the hell out of AI for most of
              this.

                Floating Box will lead you to a little note maker thing that is
                a floating div you can type into and hit enter. Then a div will
                appear that you can click and drag around the screen. You can
                keep doing that indefinitely until the screen is absolutely
                bursting with divs. It is horrible on smartphones.

                Photo Metadata is my latest and greatest use of a tool that can
                extract all of the EXIF data from your smart phone pictures. If
                you have location tracking enabled (or whatever it may be called
                on your phone) then you will be see a Google Map link appear
                upon successfully uploading a photo. The photo isn't uploaded to
                a backend, just stays in your browser and disappears when you
                hit refresh.
