                Floating Box will lead you to a little note maker thing that is
                a floating div you can type into and hit enter. Then a div will
                appear that you can click and drag around the screen. You can
                keep doing that indefinitely until the screen is absolutely
                bursting with divs. It is horrible on smartphones. I made this 
                almost entirely using AI because I was new to web dev when I made it
                and wanted to see the code would look like.

                Photo Metadata a tool that I use for one of my actual projects.
                It extracts all of the EXIF data from your smart phone pictures. If
                you have location tracking enabled (or whatever it may be called
                on your phone) then you will be see a Google Map link appear
                upon successfully uploading a photo. The photo isn't uploaded to
                a backend, just stays in your browser and disappears when you
                hit refresh.

                Fun with output tag is something I made because I read somewhere
                that you could use these tags, and I'd never heard of them. What's
                also interesting is that it doesn't require any JS Script tag.
                I wanted to see if I could do some basic calculator / concatenation 
                stuff using the oninput attribute with the form tags. It worked.

                This is related to one of my actual projects that is a work in progress.
                You can load this whole JSON file in the browser and search it for 
                Chinese characters. This allows you to see some basic info about 
                said character, like definition, pinyin / zhuyin, and the thing I 
                am the most interested in: the radicals and character components.
